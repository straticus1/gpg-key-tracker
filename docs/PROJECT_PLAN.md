## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Security-First**: All security fixes implemented immediately
2. **Incremental**: Each phase builds upon the previous
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing installations
4. **Documentation-Driven**: Update docs alongside code changes

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage for all new functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real GPG operations
3. **Security Tests**: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and load testing

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Staging Environment**: Full testing before production
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Feature flags for controlled releases
3. **Rollback Plan**: Automated rollback procedures
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring during deployments
